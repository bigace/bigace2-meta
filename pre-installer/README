QUICK GUIDE
============
For those how don't want to read first, here is the quick guide:

1. Copy the two files to your webhost:
   - install.php
   - bigace_x.x.zip

2. Open http://host/path/install.php in your browser
   (you have to replace host and path with your own settings)

3. Hit the "Install" Button, wait and then ... follow the instructions ;-)


=====================
IF THAT DOESN'T WORK
=====================
Not all systems support that auto-extracting feature. If your system doesn't 
support it or you get errors, follow this 

1. Extract the file bigace_x.x.zip manually

2. Upload the contents to your webhoster via FTP

3. Open http://host/path/install.php in your browser

4. Hit the "Install" Button, wait and then ... follow the instructions ;-)
